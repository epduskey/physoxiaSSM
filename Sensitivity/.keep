This folder contains all code necessary to replicate the sensitivity analysis, in which we repeated the entire calibration procedure three additional times with different sets of randomly generated starting values

Recall

B: oxygen dependence of benthic food carrying capacity
O: oxygen dependence of occupancy of cod in the benthic habitat
M: oxygen dependence of natural mortality of cod and flounder
P: oxygen dependence of maximum food intake, search rate, assimilation efficiency, and egg survival
None: no oxygen dependence

calibration period: 1991-2000
projection period: 2001-2019

Folders

One: folder containing all 16 project_[model].R files for calibration for model indicated by [model], a project_error.R for calculating weighted error, and a Calibration folder containing all calibration objects for the first repetition
Two: folder containing all 16 project_[model].R files for calibration for model indicated by [model], a project_error.R for calculating weighted error, and a Calibration folder containing all calibration objects for the second repetition
Three: folder containing all 16 project_[model].R files for calibration for model indicated by [model], a project_error.R for calculating weighted error, and a Calibration folder containing all calibration objects for the third repetition
Output: contains final weighted error calculations for the calibration period (cal_[repetition].txt) and for the projection period (proj_[repetition].txt)
