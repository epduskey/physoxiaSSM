Recall

B: oxygen dependence of benthic food carrying capacity
O: oxygen dependence of occupancy of cod in the benthic habitat
M: oxygen dependence of natural mortality of cod and flounder
P: oxygen dependence of maximum food intake, search rate, assimilation efficiency, and egg survival
None: no oxygen dependence

calibration period: 1991-2000
projection period: 2001-2019
